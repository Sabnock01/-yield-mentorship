Lesson 2 is for the creation of a basic vault (details [here](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/mentorship2022/issues/2)) that allows for the deposit and withdrawal of an ERC20 token specified in the vault's constructor. 

Users may rdeposit the ERC20 token into the vault as long as they themselves hold it and withdraw an amount no greater than the sum of all tokens they've put in.
